This directory contains DVI and PostScript versions of CLtL2 generated
from the original LaTeX sources. The pagination of these versions,
however, is not identical to that of the original, because our Times
Roman font is slightly wider than the one Guy Steele used to produce
the book. 

The book's index is not included in the DVI and PostScript files, due
to the difficulty of recreating them. 

Other known differences:
   +  The index pages are not included, due to the difficulty of
      recreating them.
   +  Titlepage and copyright page are missing
   +  Colophon isn't formatted the same
   +  The change bars may not necessarily be correct.
