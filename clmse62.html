The package named lisp contains the primitives of the Common Lisp system.
Its  external  symbols  include  all  of  the  user-visible  functions  and  global
variables that are present in the Common Lisp system, such as <a 
href="clmse86.html#x106-148002r444">car</a>, <a 
href="clmse86.html#x106-148004r445">cdr</a>,
and *package*. Almost all other packages will want to use lisp so that these
symbols will be accessible without qualiﬁcation.

The user package is, by default, the current package at the time a Common
Lisp system starts up. This package uses the lisp package.</div>

<!--l. 637--><p class="noindent" >X3J13 voted in March 1989 <a 
 id="dx78-117001"></a>to specify that the forthcoming ANSI Common Lisp
will use the package name common-lisp instead of lisp and the package name
common-lisp-user instead of user. The purpose is to allow a single Lisp
system to support both “old” Common Lisp and “new” ANSI Common Lisp
simultaneously despite the fact that in some cases the two languages use
the same names for incompatible purposes. (That&#x2019;s what packages are
for!)

The  package  named  common-lisp  contains  the  primitives  of  the  ANSI
Common  Lisp  system  (as  opposed  to  a  Common  Lisp  system  based  on
the 1984 speciﬁcation). Its external symbols include all of the user-visible
functions and global variables that are present in the ANSI Common Lisp
system,  such  as  <a 
href="clmse86.html#x106-148002r444">car</a>,  <a 
href="clmse86.html#x106-148004r445">cdr</a>,  and  *package*.  Note,  however,  that  the  home
package of such symbols is not necessarily the common-lisp package (this
makes it easier for symbols such as <a 
href="clmse31.html#x42-70004r20">t</a> and lambda to be shared between the
common-lisp package and another package, possibly one named lisp). Almost
all other packages ought to use common-lisp so that these symbols will be
accessible without qualiﬁcation. This package has the nickname cl.

The  common-lisp-user  package  is,  by  default,  the  current  package  at
the   time   an   ANSI   Common   Lisp   system   starts   up.   This   package
uses  the  common-lisp  package  and  has  the  nickname  cl-user.  It  may
contain  other  implementation-dependent  symbols  and  may  use  other
implementation-speciﬁc packages.</div>

This package contains all of the keywords used by built-in or user-deﬁned
Lisp functions. Printed symbol representations that start with a colon are
interpreted as referring to symbols in this package, which are always external
symbols. All symbols in this package are treated as constants that evaluate
to themselves, so that the user can type :foo instead of &#x2019;:foo.</div>

This package name is reserved to the implementation. Normally this is used
to contain names of implementation-dependent system-interface functions.
This package uses lisp and has the nickname sys.</div>

<!--l. 692--><p class="noindent" >X3J13 voted in January 1989 <a 
 id="dx78-117002"></a>to modify the requirements on the built-in packages
so as to limit what may appear in the common-lisp package and to lift the
requirement that every implementation have a package named system. The details
are as follows.
<!--l. 699--><p class="indent" >   Not only must the common-lisp package in any given implementation contain
all the external symbols prescribed by the standard; the common-lisp package
moreover may not contain any external symbol that is not prescribed by the
standard. However, the common-lisp package may contain additional internal
symbols, depending on the implementation.
<!--l. 706--><p class="indent" >   An external symbol of the common-lisp package may not have a function,
macro, or special form deﬁnition, or a top-level value, or a special proclamation,
or a type deﬁnition, unless speciﬁcally permitted by the standard. Programmers
may validly rely on this fact; for example, <a 
href="clmse35.html#x47-78023r59">fboundp</a> is guaranteed to be false for all
external symbols of the common-lisp package except those explicitly speciﬁed in
the standard to name functions, macros, and special forms. Similarly, <a 
href="clmse35.html#x47-78021r58">boundp</a> will
be false of all such external symbols except those documented to be variables or
constants.
<!--l. 716--><p class="indent" >   Portable programs may use external symbols in the common-lisp package that
are not documented to be constants or variables as names of local lexical variables
with the presumption that the implementation has not proclaimed such variables
to be special; this legitimizes the common practice of using such names as <a 
href="clmse87.html#x107-149038r493">list</a> and
<a 
href="clmse102.html#x125-167028r618">string</a> as names for local variables.
<!--l. 724--><p class="indent" >   A valid implementation may initially have properties on any symbol, or
dynamically put new properties on symbols (even user-created symbols), as long
as no property indicator used for this purpose is an external symbol of any
package deﬁned by the standard or a symbol that is accessible from the
common-lisp-user package or any package deﬁned by the user.
<!--l. 731--><p class="indent" >   This vote eliminates the requirement that every implementation have a
predeﬁned package named system. An implementation may provide any number of
                                                                          

                                                                          
predeﬁned packages; these should be described in the documentation for that
implementation.
<!--l. 736--><p class="indent" >   The common-lisp-user package may contain symbols not described by the
standard and may use other implementation-speciﬁc packages.

 id="dx78-117003"></a>to restrict user programs from performing certain
actions that might interfere with built-in facilities or interact badly with them.

of the following actions are performed on a symbol in the common-lisp
