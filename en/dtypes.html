<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   Common Lisp provides a variety of types of data objects. It is important to
note that in Lisp it is data objects that are typed, not variables. Any variable can
have any Lisp object as its value. (It is possible to make an explicit declaration
that a variable will in fact take on one of only a limited set of values. However,
such a declaration may always be omitted, and the program will still run
correctly. Such a declaration merely constitutes advice from the user that may be
useful in gaining eﬃciency. See <tt><a 
href="symbols.html#x187-2636271r271">declare</a></tt>.)
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   In Common Lisp, a data type is a (possibly inﬁnite) set of Lisp objects. Many
Lisp objects belong to more than one such set, and so it doesn&#x2019;t always make
                                                                          

                                                                          
sense to ask what is <i>the</i> type of an object; instead, one usually asks only whether
an object belongs to a given type. The predicate <tt><a 
href="symbols.html#x187-2636896r896">typep</a></tt> may be used to ask
whether an object belongs to a given type, and the function <tt><a 
href="symbols.html#x187-2636894r894">type-of</a></tt> returns <i>a</i>
type to which a given object belongs.
<!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   The data types deﬁned in Common Lisp are arranged into a hierarchy
(actually a partial order) deﬁned by the subset relationship. Certain sets of
objects, such as the set of numbers or the set of strings, are interesting enough to
deserve labels. Symbols are used for most such labels (here, and throughout this
book, the word “symbol” refers to atomic symbols, one kind of Lisp object,
elsewhere known as literal atoms). See chapter <a 
href="dtspec.html#x26-1430004">4<!--tex4ht:ref: DTSPEC --></a> for a complete description of
type speciﬁers.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   The set of all objects is speciﬁed by the symbol <tt><a 
href="symbols.html#x187-2636871r871">t</a></tt>. The empty data type, which
contains no objects, is denoted by <tt><a 
href="symbols.html#x187-2636609r609">nil</a></tt>.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   The following categories of Common Lisp objects are of particular interest:
numbers, characters, symbols, lists, arrays, structures, and functions. There are
others as well. Some of these categories have many subdivisions. There are also
standard types deﬁned to be the union of two or more of these categories. The
categories listed above, while they are data types, are neither more nor less “real”
than other data types; they simply constitute a particularly useful slice across the
type hierarchy for expository purposes.
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   Here are brief descriptions of various Common Lisp data types. The remaining
sections of this chapter go into more detail and also describe notations for objects
of each type. Descriptions of Lisp functions that operate on data objects of each
type appear in later chapters.
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><i>Numbers</i> are provided in various forms and representations. Common
      Lisp provides a true integer data type: any integer, positive or negative,
      has in principle a representation as a Common Lisp data object, subject
      only to total memory limitations (rather than machine word width).
      A true rational data type is provided: the quotient of two integers, if
      not an integer, is a ratio. Floating-point numbers of various ranges and
      precisions are also provided, as well as Cartesian complex numbers.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><i>Characters</i> represent printed glyphs such as letters or text formatting
      operations. Strings are one-dimensional arrays of characters. Common
      Lisp  provides  for  a  rich  character  set,  including  ways  to  represent
      characters of various type styles.
                                                                          

                                                                          
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><i>Symbols</i> (sometimes called <i>atomic symbols</i> for emphasis or clarity) are
      named data objects. Lisp provides machinery for locating a symbol
      object, given its name (in the form of a string). Symbols have <i>property
      lists</i>, which in eﬀect allow symbols to be treated as record structures
      with an extensible set of named components, each of which may be any
      Lisp object. Symbols also serve to name functions and variables within
      programs.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><i>Lists</i> are sequences represented in the form of linked cells called <i>conses</i>.
      There is a special object (the symbol <tt><a 
href="symbols.html#x187-2636609r609">nil</a></tt>) that is the empty list. All
      other lists are built recursively by adding a new element to the front
      of an existing list. This is done by creating a new <i>cons</i>, which is an
      object having two components called the <i>car</i> and the <i>cdr</i>. The <i>car</i> may
      hold anything, and the <i>cdr</i> is made to point to the previously existing
      list. (Conses may actually be used completely generally as two-element
      record structures, but their most important use is to represent lists.)
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><i>Arrays</i> are dimensioned collections of objects. An array can have any
      non-negative number of dimensions and is indexed by a sequence of
      integers. A general array can have any Lisp object as a component;
      other types of arrays are specialized for eﬃciency and can hold only
      certain types of Lisp objects. It is possible for two arrays, possibly
      with diﬀering dimension information, to share the same set of elements
      (such that modifying one array modiﬁes the other also) by causing one
      to be <i>displaced</i> to the other. One-dimensional arrays of any kind are
      called <i>vectors</i>. One-dimensional arrays of characters are called <i>strings</i>.
      One-dimensional arrays of bits (that is, of integers whose values are 0
      or 1) are called <i>bit-vectors</i>.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><i>Hash tables</i> provide an eﬃcient way of mapping any Lisp object (a <i>key</i>)
      to an associated object.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><i>Readtables</i> are used to control the built-in expression parser <tt><a 
href="symbols.html#x187-2636717r717">read</a></tt>.
                                                                          

                                                                          
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><i>Packages</i> are collections of symbols that serve as name spaces. The
      parser recognizes symbols by looking up character sequences in the
      current package.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><i>Pathnames</i>       represent        names        of        ﬁles        in        a
      fairly implementation-independent manner. They are used to interface
      to the external ﬁle system.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><i>Streams</i> represent sources or sinks of data, typically characters or bytes.
      They are used to perform I/O, as well as for internal purposes such as
      parsing strings.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><i>Random-states</i> are data structures used to encapsulate the state of the
      built-in random-number generator.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><i>Structures</i> are user-deﬁned record structures, objects that have named
      components. The <tt><a 
href="symbols.html#x187-2636289r289">defstruct</a></tt> facility is used to deﬁne new structure
      types. Some Common Lisp implementations may choose to implement
      certain  system-supplied  data  types,  such  as  <i>bignums</i>,  <i>readtables</i>,
      <i>streams</i>, <i>hash tables</i>, and <i>pathnames</i>, as structures, but this fact will
      be invisible to the user.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><i>Conditions</i>  are   objects   used   to   aﬀect   control   ﬂow   in   certain
      conventional  ways  by  means  of  signals  and  handlers  that  intercept
      those signals. In particular, errors are signaled by raising particular
      conditions, and errors may be trapped by establishing handlers for those
      conditions.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><i>Classes</i> determine the structure and behavior of other objects, their
      <i>instances</i>. Every Common Lisp data object belongs to some class. (In
      some ways the CLOS class system is a generalization of the system of
      type speciﬁers of the ﬁrst edition of this book, but the class system
      augments the type system rather than supplanting it.)
                                                                          

                                                                          
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><i>Methods</i> are chunks of code that operate on arguments satisfying a
      particular pattern of classes. Methods are not functions; they are not
      invoked directly on arguments but instead are bundled into generic
      functions.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><i>Generic functions</i> are functions that contain, among other information,
      a set of methods. When invoked, a generic function executes a subset
      of its methods. The subset chosen for execution depends in a speciﬁc
      way on the classes or identities of the arguments to which it is applied.</li></ul>
