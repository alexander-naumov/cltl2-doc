<!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" >In this section, we introduce changes to the terminology deﬁned in section <a 
href="clmse2.html#x8-110001.2.4">1.2.4<!--tex4ht:ref: INTRO-ERRORS --></a>.
<!--l. 116--><p class="indent" >   A condition is an interesting situation in a program that has been detected
and announced. Later we allow this term also to refer to objects that programs
use to represent such situations.
<!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >   An error is a condition in which normal program execution may not continue
without some form of intervention (either interactively by the user or under some
sort of program control, as described below).
<!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >   The process by which a condition is formally announced by a program is called
signaling. The function <a 
href="clmse155.html#x189-471006r992">signal</a> is the primitive mechanism by which such
announcement is done. Other abstractions, such as <a 
href="clmse156.html#x190-496012r1027">error</a> and <a 
href="clmse155.html#x189-471004r991">cerror</a>, are built
using <a 
href="clmse155.html#x189-471006r992">signal</a>.
<!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >   The ﬁrst edition is ambiguous about the reason why a particular program
action “is an error.” There are two principal reasons why an action may be an
error without being required to signal an error:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Detecting the error might be prohibitively expensive.
      <!--l. 135--><p class="noindent" >For example, (+ nil 3) is an error. It is likely that the designers of
      Common Lisp believed this would be an error in all implementations
      but felt it might be excessively expensive to detect the problem in
      compiled code on stock hardware, so they did not require that it signal
      an error.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Some implementations might implement the behavior as an extension.
      <!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >For example, (loop for x from 1 to 3 do (print x)) is an error because
      <a 
href="clmse42.html#x54-129002r106">loop</a> is not deﬁned to take atoms in its body. In fact, however, some
      implementations oﬀer an extension that makes this well-deﬁned. In
      order to leave room for such extensions, the ﬁrst edition used the “is
      an error” terminology to keep implementors from being forced to signal
                                                                          

                                                                          
      an error in the extended implementations.
      <!--l. 151--><p class="noindent" >[This example was written well before the vote by X3J13 in January
      1989 to add exactly this extension to the forthcoming draft standard
      (see chapter <a 
href="clmch26.html#x162-33400026">26<!--tex4ht:ref: LOOP --></a>).—GLS]</li></ul>
<!--l. 156--><p class="indent" >   In this chapter, we use the following terminology. [Compare this to the
terminology presented in section <a 
href="clmse150.html#x183-38700028.1.1">28.1.1<!--tex4ht:ref: Error-Terminology-SECTION --></a>.—GLS]
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">If the signaling of a condition or error is part of a function&#x2019;s contract
      in all situations, we say that it “signals” or “must signal” that condition
      or error.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">If the signaling of a condition or error is optional for some important
      reason (such as performance), we say that the program “might signal”
      that condition or error. In this case, we are deﬁning the operation to
      be illegal in all implementations, but allowing some implementations
      to fail to detect the error.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">If an action is left undeﬁned for the sake of implementation-dependent
      extension, we say that it “is undeﬁned” or “has undeﬁned eﬀect.” This
      means that it is not possible to depend portably upon the eﬀects of that
      action. A program that has undeﬁned eﬀect may enter the debugger,
      transfer control, or modify data in unpredictable ways.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">In the special case where only the return value of an operation is not
      well deﬁned but any side eﬀect and transfer-of-control behavior is well
      deﬁned, we say that it has “undeﬁned value.” In this case, the number
      and nature of the return values is not deﬁned, but the function can
      reasonably be expected to return. It is worth noting that under this
      description, there are some (though not many) legitimate ways in which
      such return value(s) can be used. For example, if the function foo has
      no side eﬀects and undeﬁned value, the expression (length (list (foo)))
      is completely well deﬁned even for portable code. However, the eﬀect
      of (print (list (foo))) is not well deﬁned.</li></ul>
