<div class=obsolete>
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >The compiler is a program that may make code run faster by translating
programs into an implementation-dependent form that can be executed more
eﬃciently by the computer. Most of the time you can write programs without
worrying about the compiler; compiling a ﬁle of code should produce an
equivalent but more eﬃcient program. When doing more esoteric things, you may
need to think carefully about what happens at “compile time” and what
happens at “load time.” Then the diﬀerence between the syntaxes #. and #,
becomes important, and the <a 
href="clmse30.html#x40-74003r18">eval-when</a> construct becomes particularly
useful.

   Most declarations are not used by the Common Lisp interpreter; they may be
used to give advice to the compiler. The compiler may attempt to check your
advice and warn you if it is inconsistent.
   Unlike most other Lisp dialects, Common Lisp recognizes special declarations
in interpreted code as well as compiled code. This potential source of
incompatibility between interpreted and compiled code is thereby eliminated in
Common Lisp.
   The internal workings of a compiler will of course be highly
implementation-dependent. The following functions provide a standard interface
to the compiler, however.
<div class=defun>
   <i>[Function]</i><a 
 id="dx157-318002"></a><a 
 id="x157-318003r797"></a><b> compile</b>  <i>name</i> &#x0026;optional  <i>deﬁnition</i>
   <div class=obsolete>If deﬁnition is supplied, it should be a lambda-expression, the interpreted
function to be compiled. If it is not supplied, then name should be a symbol with
a deﬁnition that is a lambda-expression; that deﬁnition is compiled and
the resulting compiled code is put back into the symbol as its function
deﬁnition.
</div>
<div class=newer>
   X3J13 voted in October 1988 <a 
 id="dx157-318004"></a>to restate the preceding paragraph more
precisely and to extend the capabilities of <a 
href="#x157-318003r797">compile</a>. If the optional deﬁnition
argument is supplied, it may be either a lambda-expression (which is coerced to a
function) or a function to be compiled; if no deﬁnition is supplied, the
<a 
href="clmse35.html#x47-89007r56">symbol-function</a> of the symbol is extracted and compiled. It is permissible for the
symbol to have a macro deﬁnition rather than a function deﬁnition; both macros
and functions may be compiled.
   It is an error if the function to be compiled was deﬁned interpretively in a
non-null lexical environment. (An implementation is free to extend the behavior of
<a 
href="#x157-318003r797">compile</a> to compile such functions properly, but portable programs may not
depend on this capability.) The consequences of calling <a 
href="#x157-318003r797">compile</a> on a function that
is already compiled are unspeciﬁed.
</div>
<div class=obsolete>
   The deﬁnition is compiled and a compiled-function object produced. If name is
a non-<a 
href="clmse31.html#x42-77002r19">nil</a> symbol, then the compiled-function object is installed as the global
function deﬁnition of the symbol and the symbol is returned. If name is
                                                                          

                                                                          
<a 
href="clmse31.html#x42-77002r19">nil</a>, then the compiled-function object itself is returned. For example: <div class=lisp>

   The :verbose argument (which defaults to the value of *compile-verbose*), if

</div>
<div class=newer>
   X3J13 voted in June 1989 <a 
 id="dx157-318017"></a>to specify restrictions on conforming programs to
ensure consistent handling of symbols and packages.
   In order to guarantee that compiled ﬁles can be loaded correctly, the user must
ensure that the packages referenced in the ﬁle are deﬁned consistently at compile
and load time. Conforming Common Lisp programs must satisfy the following
requirements.
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">The value of <a 
href="clmse63.html#x79-187003r173">*package*</a> when a top-level form in the ﬁle is processed by

href="clmse63.html#x79-187003r173">*package*</a> when the code
      corresponding to that top-level form in the compiled ﬁle is executed
      by the loader. In particular, any top-level form in a ﬁle that alters the
      value of <a 
href="clmse63.html#x79-187003r173">*package*</a> must change it to a package of the same name at
      both compile and load time; moreover, if the ﬁrst non-atomic top-level
      form in the ﬁle is not a call to <a

      processing of that top-level form at compile time, but whose home

form until it can be done in the run-time environment.
<!--l. 315--><p class="indent" >   If a <a 
href="#x157-318033r804">load-time-value</a> expression is seen by <a 
href="#x157-318011r799">compile-ﬁle</a>, the compiler performs
its normal semantic processing (such as macro expansion and translation into
machine code) on the form, but arranges for the execution of the form to
occur at load time in a null lexical environment, with the result of this
evaluation then being treated as an immediate quantity (that is, as if
originally quoted) at run time. It is guaranteed that the evaluation of the
form will take place only once when the ﬁle is loaded, but the order of
evaluation with respect to the execution of top-level forms in the ﬁle is
unspeciﬁed.
<!--l. 326--><p class="indent" >   If a <a 
href="#x157-318033r804">load-time-value</a> expression appears within a function compiled with

<!--l. 331--><p class="indent" >   In interpreted code, form is evaluated (by <a

compile) expressions passed to <a 
href="clmse110.html#x135-261002r620">eval</a> may evaluate the form only once, at the time
this compilation is performed. This is intentionally similar to the freedom that
implementations are given for the time of expanding macros in interpreted
code.
<!--l. 339--><p class="indent" >   If the same (as determined by <a

once or is evaluated more than once. This can happen both when an
expression being evaluated or compiled shares substructure and when the
same expression is passed to <a 
href="clmse110.html#x135-261002r620">eval</a> or to <a

<a 
href="#x157-318033r804">load-time-value</a> expression may be referenced in more than one place and may be
evaluated multiple times by the interpreter, it is unspeciﬁed whether each
execution returns a “fresh” object or returns the same object as some other
execution. Users must use caution when destructively modifying the resulting
object.
<!--l. 351--><p class="indent" >   If two lists (load-time-value form) are <a

ordinary, modiﬁable data. If <a

   The argument should be a function object, a lambda-expression, or a symbol
with a function deﬁnition. If the relevant function is not a compiled function, it is
ﬁrst compiled. In any case, the compiled code is then “reverse-assembled” and
printed out in a symbolic format. This is primarily useful for debugging the

   X3J13 voted in January 1989 <a 
 id="dx157-319008"></a>to add a new function to allow the source code
for a deﬁned function to be recovered. (The committee noted that the ﬁrst edition
provided no portable way to recover a lambda-expression once it had been
compiled or evaluated to produce a function.)
   This function takes one argument, which must be a function, and returns three
values.
   The ﬁrst value is the deﬁning lambda-expression for the function, or <a 
href="clmse31.html#x42-77002r19">nil</a> if
that information is not available. The lambda-expression may have been
preprocessed in some ways but should nevertheless be of a form suitable as
an argument to the function <a 
href="#x157-318003r797">compile</a> or for use in the <a 
href="clmse35.html#x47-88006r54">function</a> special
form.
   The second value is <a 
href="clmse31.html#x42-77002r19">nil</a> if the function was deﬁnitely produced by
closing a lambda-expression in the null lexical environment; it is some
non-<a 
href="clmse31.html#x42-77002r19">nil</a> value if the function might have been closed in some non-null lexical
environment.
   The third value is the “name” of the function; this is <a 
href="clmse31.html#x42-77002r19">nil</a> if the name is
not available or if the function had no name. The name is intended for
debugging purposes only and may be any Lisp object (not necessarily one that
would be valid for use as a name in a <a 
href="clmse30.html#x40-69002r13">defun</a> or <a 
href="clmse35.html#x47-88006r54">function</a> special form, for
example).
<div class=implementation>
   <b>Implementation note:</b> An implementation is always free to return the values <a

<a 
href="clmse31.html#x42-77002r19">nil</a> from this function but is encouraged to make more useful information available as
appropriate. For example, it may not be desirable for ﬁles of compiled code to retain the
source lambda-expressions for use after the ﬁle is loaded, but it is probably
desirable for functions produced by “in-core” calls to <a

href="#x157-318003r797">compile</a>, or <a

retain the deﬁning lambda-expression for debugging purposes. The function
<a

is unspeciﬁed which will prevail within the compiled code (unless some
other behavior is explicitly speciﬁed below). It is also permissible for an
implementation to signal an error at run time on detecting such a discrepancy.
In all cases, the absence of the information at compile time is not an
error, but its presence may enable the compiler to generate more eﬃcient

<!--l. 924--><p class="noindent" >X3J13 voted in March 1989 <a 
 id="dx157-324001"></a>to specify what objects can be in compiled constants
and what relationship there must be between a constant passed to the
compiler and the one that is established by compiling it and then loading its
ﬁle.
<!--l. 930--><p class="indent" >   The key is a deﬁnition of an equivalence relationship called “similarity as
constants” between Lisp objects. Code passed through the ﬁle compiler and then
loaded must behave as though quoted constants in it are similar in this sense to
quoted constants in the corresponding source code. An object may be used as a
quoted constant processed by <a 
href="#x157-318011r799">compile-ﬁle</a> if and only if the compiler can
guarantee that the resulting constant established by loading the compiled ﬁle is
“similar as a constant” to the original. Speciﬁc requirements are spelled out
below.
<!--l. 941--><p class="indent" >   Some types of objects, such as streams, are not supported in constants
processed by the ﬁle compiler. Such objects may not portably appear as constants
in code processed with <a 
href="#x157-318011r799">compile-ﬁle</a>. Conforming implementations are required to
handle such objects either by having the compiler or loader reconstruct an
equivalent copy of the object in some implementation-speciﬁc manner or by
having the compiler signal an error.
<!--l. 949--><p class="indent" >   Of the types supported in constants, some are treated as aggregate objects.
For these types, being similar as constants is deﬁned recursively. We say that an
object of such a type has certain “basic attributes”; to be similar as a constant to
another object, the values of the corresponding attributes of the two objects must
also be similar as constants.
<!--l. 956--><p class="indent" >   A deﬁnition of this recursive form has problems with any circular or inﬁnitely
recursive object such as a list that is an element of itself. We use the
idea of depth-limited comparison and say that two objects are similar as
constants if they are similar at all ﬁnite levels. This idea is implicit in
the deﬁnitions below, and it applies in all the places where attributes
of two objects are required to be similar as constants. The question of
handling circular constants is the subject of a separate vote by X3J13 (see
below).
<!--l. 965--><p class="indent" >   The following terms are used throughout this section. The term constant refers
to a quoted or self-evaluating constant, not a named constant deﬁned by

macro expansion during ﬁle compilation. The term compiled code is used to refer
