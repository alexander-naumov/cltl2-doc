<!--l. 1159--><p class="noindent" >Series expressions are transformed into loops by pipelining them—the
computation is converted from a form where entire series are computed one
after the other to a form where the series are incrementally computed in
parallel. In the resulting loop, each individual element is computed just once,
used, and then discarded before the next element is computed. For this
pipelining to be possible, a number of restrictions have to be satisﬁed. Before
these restrictions are explained, it will be useful to consider a related
issue.
<!--l. 1168--><p class="indent" >   The composition of two series functions cannot be pipelined unless the
destination function consumes series elements in the same order that
the source function produces them. Taken together, the series functions
guarantee that this will always be true, because they all follow the same
ﬁxed processing order. In particular, they are all <i>preorder</i> functions—they
process the elements of their series inputs and outputs in ascending order
starting with the ﬁrst element. Further, while it is easy for users to deﬁne
new series functions, it is impossible to deﬁne one that is not a preorder
function.
<!--l. 1178--><p class="indent" >   It turns out that most series operations can easily be implemented in a
preorder fashion, the most notable exceptions being reversal and sorting. As a
result, little is lost by outlawing non-preorder series functions. If some
non-preorder operation has to be applied to a series, the series can be collected
into a list or vector and the operation applied to this new data structure. (This is
ineﬃcient, but no less eﬃcient than what would be required if non-preorder series
functions were supported.)

optimization is not possible. In this situation, a warning message is issued at the

it is well worth ﬁxing any violations that occur. This is usually easy to
do.

</div>
<!--l. 1206--><p class="indent" >   Before the restrictions on series expressions are discussed, it will be useful to
deﬁne precisely what is meant by the term <i>series expression</i>. This term is
semantic rather than syntactic in nature. Imagine a program converted from
Lisp code into a data ﬂow graph. In a data ﬂow graph, functions are
represented as boxes, and both control ﬂow and data ﬂow are represented as
arrows between the boxes. Constructs such as <a 
href="clmse39.html#x51-100002r74">let</a> and <a 
href="clmse35.html#x47-87002r59">setq</a> are converted
into patterns of data ﬂow arcs. Control constructs such as <a 
href="clmse136.html#x167-340002r834">if</a> and <a 
href="clmse42.html#x54-118002r90">loop</a>
are converted into patterns of control ﬂow arcs. Suppose further that
all loops have been converted into tail recursions so that the graph is
acyclic.
<!--l. 1217--><p class="indent" >   A series expression is a subgraph of the data ﬂow graph for a program that
contains a group of interacting series functions. More speciﬁcally, given a call <i>f </i> on
a series function, the series expression <i>E</i> containing it is deﬁned as follows. <i>E</i>
contains <i>f </i>. Every function using a series created by a function in <i>E</i> is in <i>E</i>.
Every function computing a series used by a function in <i>E</i> is in <i>E</i>. Finally,
suppose that two functions <i>g</i> and <i>h</i> are in <i>E</i> and that there is a data ﬂow
path consisting of series and/or non-series data ﬂow arcs from <i>g</i> to <i>h</i>.
Every function touched by this path (be it a series function or not) is
in <i>E</i>.
<!--l. 1227--><p class="indent" >   For optimization to be possible, series expressions have to be
statically analyzable. As with most other optimization processes, a series
expression cannot be transformed into a loop at compile time, unless it can be
determined at compile time exactly what computation is being performed. This
places a number of relatively minor limits on what can be written. For example,
                                                                          

                                                                          
for optimization to be possible the type arguments to higher-order functions such
as <a 
href="clmse153.html#x188-477002r1029">map-fn</a> and <a 
href="clmse153.html#x188-480012r1037">collecting-fn</a> have to be quoted constants. Similarly, the
numeric arguments to <a 
href="clmse153.html#x188-481022r1048">chunk</a> have to be constants. In addition, if <a 
href="clmse37.html#x49-95004r69">funcall</a> is
used to call a series function, the function called has to be of the form
(function ...).
<!--l. 1239--><p class="indent" >   For optimization to be possible, every series created within a series
expression must be used solely inside the expression. If a series is
transmitted outside of the expression that creates it, it has to be physically
represented as a whole. This is incompatible with the transformations
required to pipeline the creating expression. To avoid this problem, a
series must not be returned as a result of a series expression as a whole,
assigned to a free variable, assigned to a special variable, or stored in a
data structure. A corollary of the last point is that when deﬁning new
optimizable series functions, series cannot be passed into &#x0026;rest arguments.
Further, optimization is blocked if a series is passed as an argument to an
ordinary Lisp function. Series can be passed only to the series functions in
section <a 
href="clmse153.html#x188-475000A.2">A.2<!--tex4ht:ref: SERIES-F-SECTION --></a> and to new series functions deﬁned using the declaration
<a 
href="#x189-487002r1071">optimizable-series-function</a>.
<!--l. 1253--><p class="indent" >   For optimization to be possible, series expressions must correspond
to straight-line computations. That is to say, the data ﬂow graph
corresponding to a series expression cannot contain any conditional branches.
(Complex control ﬂow is incompatible with pipelining.) Optimization is possible
in the presence of standard straight-line forms such as <a 
href="clmse38.html#x50-96002r71">progn</a>, <a 
href="clmse37.html#x49-95004r69">funcall</a>, <a 
href="clmse35.html#x47-87002r59">setq</a>,
lambda, <a 
href="clmse39.html#x51-100002r74">let</a>, <a 
href="clmse39.html#x51-101002r75">let*</a>, and multiple-value-bind as long as none of the variables bound
are special. There is also no problem with macros as long as they expand into
series functions and straight-line forms. However, optimization is blocked by forms
that specify complex control ﬂow (i.e., conditionals <a 
href="clmse136.html#x167-340002r834">if</a>, <a 
href="clmse40.html#x52-109002r84">cond</a>, etc., looping
constructs <a 
href="clmse42.html#x54-118002r90">loop</a>, <a 
href="clmse137.html#x168-342002r837">do</a>, etc., or branching constructs <a

href="clmse42.html#x54-128002r104">go</a>, <a 
href="clmse44.html#x56-139006r114">catch</a>,
etc.).
<!--l. 1267--><p class="indent" >   In the ﬁrst example below, optimization is blocked, because the <a 
href="clmse136.html#x167-340002r834">if</a> form is
inside the series expression. In the second example, however, optimization is
possible, because although the <a 
href="clmse136.html#x167-340002r834">if</a> feeds data to the series expression, it is not inside
the corresponding subgraph. Both of the expressions below produce the same
value, but the second one is much more eﬃcient. <div class=lisp><div class=tabbing>

<!--l. 1379--><p class="indent" >   The restriction that optimizable series expressions cannot contain constraint
cycles that pass through non-series outputs places limitations on the qualitative
character of optimizable series expressions. In particular, they all must have the
general form of creating some number of series using scanners, computing various
intermediate series using transducers, and then computing one or more
summary results using collectors. The output of a collector cannot be used
in the intermediate computation unless it is the output of a separate
subexpression.

by moving the non-series output out of the cycle, rather than by breaking the

they pass through <i>oﬀ-line</i> ports.

on-line input is read, then the second element of each on-line output is

otherwise, it is oﬀ-line. (The above extends the standard deﬁnition of

possible, a series expression cannot contain a constraint cycle that
passes through a non-series output or an oﬀ-line port. Whenever this
restriction is violated a warning message is issued. Violations can be ﬁxed either
by breaking the cycle or restructuring the computation so that the oﬀending port
is removed from the cycle.

<!--l. 1476--><p class="noindent" >A key feature of Lisp is that variable declarations are strictly optional.
Nevertheless, it is often the case that they are necessary in situations where
eﬃciency matters. Therefore, it is important that it be possible for programmers
to provide declarations for every variable in a program. The transformation of
series expressions into loops presents certain problems in this regard,
because the loops created contain variables not evident in the original
code. However, if the information described below is supplied by the user,

created.
